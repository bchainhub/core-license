# CORE License ⊛

## 📜 What is the CORE License?

The **CORE License** is a **free and open-source software (FOSS) license** that allows **anyone** to use, modify, distribute, and even sell software under its terms. However, **if you modify the software and share it**, you must also **make the source code available to the public**.

This ensures transparency, collaboration, and innovation while keeping the software **accessible for everyone**.

## ✅ What You Can Do

✔ **Use** the software for any purpose.  
✔ **Modify** the software to fit your needs.  
✔ **Share** the software with others.  
✔ **Sell** your version of the software.  
✔ **Combine** it with other projects.  

If you **create**, **modify**, and **distribute** the software, you must **share your source code** so others can also benefit from your changes.

## 🚫 What You Cannot Do

❌ You **cannot** claim the software as entirely your own.  
❌ You **cannot** distribute a modified version **without** making the source code available.  
❌ You **cannot** hold the authors legally responsible for any issues.  

The software is provided **“as is”**, meaning **no guarantees**—if something goes wrong, it’s on you!

## ⊛ What is This Symbol?

The **⊛ (circled asterisk)** is the **official symbol of the CORE License**.

### 🎨 Meaning Behind the Symbol

- **The circle (○)** symbolizes the license specification, as we see in copyright or Creative Commons.  
- **The six-sided asterisk inside (*)** represents **openness and inclusivity**—the software is for everyone.
